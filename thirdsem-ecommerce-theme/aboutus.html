      				<p>Many people define e-commerce as selling or purchasing a physical product online. But the meaning of e-commerce also encompasses the sale and purchase of non-physical goods, such as services and digital products. Essentially, it's when a business sells online.

						Some e-commerce retailers sell exclusively online. For example, let’s say an entrepreneur sets up a company selling high-end pet products. In the pre-internet days, they would have had 2 choices: retail their merchandise through their own boutique pet shop, or sell it wholesale to national pet goods stores. Today, those business owners have a third option: e-commerce. They can sell their products through their own website, a third-party site, or both.
						
						The lines between e-commerce and traditional retail overlap sometimes. When a customer comparison shops with her smartphone while standing in a brick-and-mortar store browsing its physical products, it’s hard to classify the experience as one or the other.
